## Bible translations/versions

This app natively uses _.yes_ files for the Bible text. You can create a _.yes_ file easily by preparing a plain text file. See <a href="https://alkitab.app/developer">this page for</a> instructions.

You can also convert PalmBible+ PDB files using the built-in converter in the app for your own use.

Tools for converting PalmBible+ PDB files to _.yet_ files, and from _.yet_ files to _.yes_ files and internal app files, are available at in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0mZXH9nEuQ0dGdxbUI5T1lyeUU?resourcekey=0-V_emMiw0Q1APka5ddsS2rA&usp=sharing).
